# List_PDF_as_XML
Takes every PDF in a Folder and lists them in one XML file, plus their required Metadata for further steps.


The script is meant as one Step in a more extensive process. It automates tasks that had to be done by hand prior.

The PDF files folder must be named correctly for the script to work.
"HZ ET XX.XX.XXXX"
"HZ ET 30.11.2021"

The script will take the Date from the Foldername and, to prevent wrong XML files from being generated, won't run if the folder is named wrong.
